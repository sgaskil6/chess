# README

Final project of the Odin Project - a Chess game played through the CLI.

This was my favorite and most robust project to-date and taught me many valuable coding principles/practices and gave me the chance to put them into use right away.
I chose to follow Andrew Hayhursts' Chess project (github - ), as it was more developed/refined than my original project, showed me ways to improve my code and also provided much needed help with adding better testing to my project. With the timing of the Queens Gambit tv show, the history portion of Andrew's project was particularly interesting and it was good to try to get my history portion close to his. 

Rules to observe:
1) Game should be properly constrained - should prevent players from making illegal moves and declare check or checkmate in the correct situation
2) Allow players to save the board at anytime (serialize the board)
3) Add simple AI player
4) Board must provide piece moving routines, as well as being aware of castling, check, etc.

RULES OF CHESS:

MAJOR PIECES: Rook, Queen, King
MINOR PIECES: Pawn, Knight, Bishop

Possibly add example movement of each piece or include image chart ab

Will probably move the pieces to the model folder instead of lib, but that depends on deployment

Using helper methods to make the code more readable and cut down on the amount of code 

I'll use knowledge from building 'Knights Travails', a project where I built a chess game board and one single, movable knight piece.
