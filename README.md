Final project of the Odin Project - a Chess game played through the CLI.

This was my favorite and most robust project to-date and taught me many valuable coding principles.

Rules to observe:
1) Game should be properly constrained - should prevent players from making illegal moves and declare check or checkmate in the correct situation
2) Allow players to save the board at anytime (serialize the board)
3) Add simple AI player
4) Board must provide piece moving routines, as well as being aware of castling, check, etc.

RULES OF CHESS:

MAJOR PIECES: Rook, Queen, King
MINOR PIECES: Pawn, Knight, Bishop

Possibly add example movement of each piece or include image chart 

I'll use knowledge from building 'Knights Travails', a project where I built a chess game board and one single, movable knight piece.
